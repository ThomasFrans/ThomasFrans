### Description
Hi, I'm just me. Yup, I never know what to write in these. I like sofware (a lot). Linux (read Arch), Open Source, programming, software architecture... I didn't say I'm good at any of these, just that I'm interested. I also love messing around with electronics from time to time. Analog, digital, stuff I probably shouldn't be messing with in the first place like live wires, the whole bunch.

### Style
Don't have any. Never had. Unless we're talking software, in which case I'd have to say üêç_case. Nothing goes above a simple snek.

### Building
Uh, to start building me, get me some tea, everything should be automatic from there on out.

### Bugs
I hate 'em. Both in software and in real life.

### Contributing
I'm always down to learn new things, and I'll get things wrong (very often). I like to contribute to easier Rust projects for now, to try and get a better grasp of Rust in general. I also know c, c++ and Java, but haven't used those in a while since I prefer Rust.
